## ðŸš€ Setting up Production

> Resizing images requires a paid Cloudflare Pro plan.

### API (Prod)

For deployed environments, you can use wrangler secrets to set `APP_URL` and `JWT_VERIFICATION_KEY` values.

For example:

Run `echo <VALUE> | wrangler secret put <NAME>` for each of these

Or [use the Cloudflare web interface](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/environment-variables/#environment-variables-via-the-dashboard).

### ðŸ¤« Setup CI/CD Secrets

> Secrets are secure environment variables you provide GitHub so that you don't need to hard code the project-token in your workflow file.

#### ðŸ”— Next.js

1. Deploying to Cloudflare Pages requires the following secrets added to your GitHub repository:

```bash
CF_API_TOKEN=
CF_ACCOUNT_ID=
CF_PROJECT_NAME=
```

2. Disable `Enable automatic production branch deployments` in the Cloudflare Pages dashboard. This conflicts with our Github Actions.

#### ðŸ“± Expo

```bash
TODO=
```

## Configure Wrangler.toml

> Wrangler is the official CLI tool for Cloudflare Workers.

Replace the `account_id` and `database_id` with your own values.

### API Wranger.toml

```toml
name = "t4-api"
compatibility_date = "2023-01-01"
send_metrics = false
account_id = "your_account_id"

[[ d1_databases ]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "your_db_name"
database_id = "your_db_id"
```

### Next.js Wranger.toml

> Replace the `name` and `route` values with your own.

```toml
[env.preview]
name = "t4-app-preview"
workers_dev = true

[env.production]
name = "t4-app"
route = "app.t4stack.com/*"
workers_dev = false
```

## Environment Variables

Configure environment variables within the Cloudflare Pages dashboard for production.

> Your API server runs as a Cloudflare Worker. Cloudflare is working on combining the Workers and Pages dashboards, so you can configure your environment variables in one place.

```bash
# Change the name of this file to .env and add your own values

# API
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://api.t4stack.com/

# Authentication
# @link https://dashboard.clerk.dev for your Clerk API keys
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=
```
